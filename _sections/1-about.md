# Why Jekyll for a single page site?

- Maintainabile: focus on content when editing content, not markup.
- Configurable: if you like the default look, you can make it your own by just editing `_config.yml`
- Extensibile: easily add a blog or another page with zero copy and paste.
- Fun: you're a webdev nerd and tooling is fun.
